% Table of contents of some sorts

% Laboratory 5

% 1. a => confidence interval for a population mean with sigma known
% 1. b => confidence interval for a population mean with sigma unknown
% 1. c => confidence interval for a population variance (and standard
% deviation)

% 2. a => confidence inverval for the difference of the true means with
% sigma_1 = sigma_2, unknown
% 2. b => confidence interval for the difference of the true means with
% sigma_1 != sigma_2, unknown
% 2. c => confidence interval for the ratio of the variances

% Laboratory 6

% 1. a => left-tailed test for the mean (sigma known) - ztest, norminv
% 1. b => right-tailed test for the mean (sigma unknown) - ttest, tinv

% 2. a => two-tailed test for the population variances - vartest2, finv
% 2. b => right-tailed test for the difference of means - ttest2, tinv
